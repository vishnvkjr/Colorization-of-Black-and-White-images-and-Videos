# Colorization-of-Black-and-White-images-and-Videos

Objective: To create realistic and visually pleasing colorizations, we utilize pre-trained models and specific files 
such as 'colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt,' 'colorization_release_v2.caffemodel,' and 'pts_in_hull.npy' to learn and 
generate the desired outcomes.
